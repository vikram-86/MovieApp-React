# React Native Movie App - Tech Study Case

## Introduction

This project is a technical study case focused on creating a movie application using React Native. The goal of this project is to explore various aspects of mobile app development using modern frameworks and tools such as React Native, TypeScript, and Expo. The app fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API, allowing users to search for movies, view details, and manage a list of their favorite movies.

### Key Features:
- **Home Screen**: Displays a list of popular movies fetched from the TMDB API.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for movies by title.
- **Movie Details**: Displays detailed information about selected movies, including a full-screen background image.
- **Favorites Management**: Users can add or remove movies from their favorites list, which is persisted locally on the device.

## Frameworks and Technology Used

- **React Native**: The main framework used for building the mobile application.
- **TypeScript**: Used for static type checking to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **Expo**: A framework and platform for universal React applications, simplifying the development process.
- **React Navigation**: Handles navigation between different screens in the app.
- **expo-blur**: Provides blur effects used in the app to enhance the user interface.
- **TMDB API**: The external API used to fetch movie data.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally using npm or npx

Code is written in VSCode

#### Testing the App

-	You can test the app on an emulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.
-	Scan the QR code provided by Expo in the terminal to run the app on your device.
-	```bash npx expo start``` in terminal
